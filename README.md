# Python API Challenge

# Project Description

## Part-One: Weather API
  - Create plots to show the relationship between weather variables and latitude including variables like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and          wind speed. 
  - Compute the linear regression for each of the relationships between latitude and temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and wind speed and explain the relationships for each of the variable pairs. 

## Part-Two: VacationPy
- Create a map highlighting every city in the dataframe from Part-One. 
- Filter the dataframe to only include the ideal weather conditions.
- Create a new dataframe based on these parameters and create a blank hotel column. 
- Use Geoapify API to find hotels within 10,000 meters of the coordinates in the dataframe and populate a table with these hotels. If no hotel can be found within the radius, print "No hotel found."
- Add the functionality for users to be able to hover over the map and look at the hotel name and country for those coordinates.
